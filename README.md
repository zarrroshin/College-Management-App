# University Flutter App Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project developed for a university course. The project involves creating a Flutter application that interacts with a Java backend using server socket programming. The application is built following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase. The project also includes a graphical command-line interface (CLI) and uses text files for a limited university database, with SQL code integrated for future database expansion. Data transfer between the frontend and backend is handled via REST API using fetch requests for GET and POST methods.

## Features

- **Flutter Frontend**: A sleek and responsive user interface built with Flutter, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.
- **Java Backend**: A robust backend implemented in Java, handling server-side logic and data processing.
- **Server Socket Programming**: Real-time communication between the Flutter frontend and Java backend using server socket programming.
- **Graphical Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A graphical CLI tool to manage and interact with the server-side components, providing an additional layer of control and functionality.
- **MVC Design Pattern**: The project adheres to the MVC design pattern, promoting a clear separation of concerns and enhancing code modularity.
- **REST API**: Data is transferred using fetch requests in the Flutter frontend and handled in the Java backend via GET and POST methods.

## Project Structure

- **Flutter Application**: Contains the code for the Flutter frontend, including UI components, state management, and network requests.
  - `lib/`: Main directory for Flutter code.
    - `views/`: UI components and screens.

- **Java Server**: Contains the code for the Java backend, including server socket implementation and business logic.
  - `Backend/src/main/java`: Main directory for Java code.
    - `controllers/`: Java controllers handling incoming requests and responses.
    - `models/`: Data models representing server-side data structures.
    - `services/`: Services for processing data and managing socket connections.
    - `cli/`: Graphical Command-Line Interface tool for managing the server.
    - `database/`: Directory containing text files for the limited university database and SQL code for database operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed. Follow the instructions on the [Flutter official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
